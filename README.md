# Project Overview
PlanMyTrip is an app that allows users to input their ideal weather conditions and match them up with a location and hotel that suits what they are looking for.  The location is then charted on a map, along with the ability to chart multiple stops for a trip. 
This project develops the code for doing all of this by using various APIs to get information about a location and organize the data in an easily understandable format.
