# World_Weather_Analysis

# Project Overview
PlanMyTrip is an app that allows users to input their ideal weather conditions and match them up with a location and hotel that suits what they are looking for.  The location is then charted on a map, along with the ability to chart multiple stops for a trip. 
This project develops the code for doing all of this by using various APIs to get information about a location and organize the data in an easily understandable format.


# How to use:

You can immediatly use this program as soon as you download it from the repository. If you want an immediate use, please use the 'VacationPy.ipynb' file. The set up to it includes showing you a heatmap of things such as temperature, hummidity, cloudiness and windiness.  (See below for example of how a heatmap based on temperature looks.)

After all the heatmaps are loaded, then you can proceed to customize your vacation. There is a section to fill in the maximum and minimum temperatures you desire. After that's filled in, the code will display the top 10 cities that fit your criteria. (If you would like more, you may edit the code from 'preferred_cities_df.head(10)' to a new number in replace of the '10'.)

Once that's done, the code will give you a lodging accomidation that is in the zone of the travel destination. At the end of the code, it will also give you a interactive map that allows you to play around with the map and check out various destinations that have been generated by the information given by way of markers.

# Additional conisderations for personal usage

Please note, this was configured for a specific time and date, and also based off variables within the 'WeatherPy.ipynb'. If you would like to get an updated version of temperatures for cities and dates, please rerun the code. If you would like a new set of cities, please rerun 'WeatherPy.ipynb' as well. Additional note, everytime 'WeatherPy.ipynb' is run, it will generate a new random list of cities, so take precaution. 

Also, please make sure you have your own config file with a variable named "g_key" set to a working Google API code if the maps are not properly showing up.
